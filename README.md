# Sequence Labelling

The task "Emerging and Rare entity recognition" that is based on the Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT) was used to train a Name Entity Recognition (NER) classifier

Hyperparameter optimization and engineering of additional features were performed in order to experiment and evaluate their effect on the quality of labelling.

## Running the experiments

In order to run the experiments for hyperparameter optimization, and feature engineering, use the following command:
~~~
$ python main.py
~~~

## Statistical Analysis
For statistics related to the given data set, the following command should be executed:
~~~
$ python statistical.py
~~~
